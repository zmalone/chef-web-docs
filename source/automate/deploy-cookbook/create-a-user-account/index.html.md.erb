In this part, you perform three administrative tasks &ndash; create the organization, add a user account, and configure the Windows workstation to connect to Chef Automate as that user.

An organization enables you to group related projects and provide scope for authorization rules. User accounts enable end users to access Chef Automate through its web interface or from the command line.

Here's what you'll do:

1. [Connect to the Windows workstation](#step1)
1. [Log in to the Chef Automate web interface](#step2)
1. [Add a user](#step3)
1. [Sign out of the Chef Automate web interface](#step4)
1. [Update your Chef Automate user with an SSH public key](#step5)
1. [Connect the Chef Automate CLI to the Chef Automate server](#step6)
1. [Set your Git identity](#step7)

[START_BOX]

## 1. Connect to the Windows workstation

If you temporarily stopped your instances, [restart them now](/automate/install/managing-your-aws-instances#stoppingandrestartingyourawsinstances) and [update your RDP connection](/automate/install/managing-your-aws-instances#gettingthewindowsworkstationpublicipaddress) with the Windows workstation's new public IP address.

If you closed the connection to your environment's Windows workstation, [connect to it now](/automate/install/install-chef-automate#step5) and [open up PowerShell](/automate/install/install-chef-automate#step6) through the Chef DK desktop shortcut.

From PowerShell, ensure you're in the home directory.

```ps
# C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop
$ cd C:\Users\Administrator
```

[END_BOX]

[START_BOX]

## 2. Log in to the Chef Automate web interface

### Open Google Chrome

Start by opening **Google Chrome** on your Windows workstation. Then navigate to [https://delivery.chordata.biz/e/mammalia/#/dashboard](https://delivery.chordata.biz/e/mammalia/#/dashboard). Or choose the **Chef Delivery** bookmark from the **Demo** folder in Google Chrome.

If you logged out from your previous session, login as the `admin` user. The password is `eval4me!`.

You'll see the Chef Automate dashboard.

## 3. Add a user

Now you'll add a user.

Select **Organizations** from the drop-down menu in the upper right corner.

![](automate/wf-orgs.png)

Select the **Users** tab.

![](automate/wf-users-tab.png)

Click **+ New User**, then fill in the fields. The screen image below is an example. You can specify your real info if you prefer.

Leave the **Enter SSH Public Key** field blank &ndash; you'll set that up in the next part.

In practice, you would determine the appropriate [roles and permissions](https://docs.chef.io/delivery_users_and_roles.html#roles-and-permissions) for your user. For now, select all roles.

![](automate/wf-add-user.png)

When you're done, click **Save & Close**.

[COMMENT] Do not modify the `builder` account. Chef Automate requires these settings to enable build nodes to perform jobs.

## 4. Sign out of the Chef Automate web interface

In the next part, you'll set up the Windows workstation to interact with Chef Automate. Sign out of the Chef Automate web interface &ndash; you'll sign back in using the credentials you just set up.

From the menu in the upper-right corner of the web interface, select **Sign Out**.

[END_BOX]

## 5. Update your Chef Automate user with an SSH public key

At this point, you have a user account and its initial password set up.

You need to associate your public SSH key with your Chef Automate user. This key enables you to authenticate requests to Chef Automate from the command line.

In practice, you would [generate an SSH keypair](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-ssh-keys--2). The Windows workstation comes with an SSH keypair that you can use in the <% fp 'C:\Users\Administrator\\\.ssh' %> directory. <% fp 'id_rsa' %> is the private part of the keypair; <% fp 'id_rsa.pub' %> is the public part.

Copy the public part of your SSH key, <% fp 'C:\Users\Administrator\\\.ssh\id_rsa.pub' %>, to the clipboard. You can open the file in a text editor or run this from your PowerShell prompt.

```ps
# C:\Users\Administrator
$ Get-Content C:\Users\Administrator\.ssh\id_rsa.pub | clip
```

Next, log in to the Chef Automate web interface from Google Chrome. [https://delivery.chordata.biz/e/mammalia/#/login](https://delivery.chordata.biz/e/mammalia/#/login)

Enter your username and password for the user you set up in [step 3](#step3).

Next, select **Organizations** from the drop-down menu in the upper right corner.

![](automate/wf-select-admin.png)

From the **Users** tab, select your username and then paste your SSH key into the text area under **Security Information**.

![](automate/wf-add-ssh-key.png)

Click **Save & Close**.

[END_BOX]

[START_BOX]

## 6. Connect the Chef Automate CLI to the Chef Automate server

Next, you'll run the `delivery setup` command to configure the CLI to contact the Chef Automate server. The command creates a configuration file named <% fp '.delivery\cli.toml' %>.

The placement of the `.delivery` directory in your file hierarchy is significant. Like Git, the delivery CLI searches the current directory and parent directories for its server settings. Because server settings are unique to an organization, we recommend that you create a directory for each organization you belong to and run the `delivery setup` command from that directory.

From your command prompt, configure the CLI to contact the Chef Automate server at <code class="placeholder">delivery.chordata.biz</code>, replacing <code class="placeholder">USER</code> with your username.

```ps
# C:\Users\Administrator
$ delivery setup --server=delivery.chordata.biz --ent=mammalia --org=diprotodontia --user=USER
Chef Delivery
Loading configuration from C:\Users\Administrator
Writing configuration to C:\Users\Administrator\.delivery\cli.toml
New configuration
-----------------
api_protocol = "https"
enterprise = "mammalia"
git_port = "8989"
organization = "diprotodontia"
pipeline = "master"
server = "delivery.chordata.biz"
user = "USER"
```

## 7. Set your Git identity

Run `git config` to set your [Git identity](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-First-Time-Git-Setup#Your-Identity). Git includes this information as metadata when you commit changes.

If you have an existing Git account, such as with GitHub, you can use the same information here (changes you make in this tutorial won't be published as public activity on your GitHub account.)

Here's an example.

```ps
# C:\Users\Administrator
$ git config --global user.name "John Smith"
$ git config --global user.email jsmith@example.com
```

Your workstation is now set up.
