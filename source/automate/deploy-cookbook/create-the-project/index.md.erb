Chef Automate uses _projects_ to organize work across multiple teams. You can create as many projects as you need. A common approach is to have one project for each major component of your system.

Each project has its own Git repository. Chef Automate can host the Git repository for you or you can connect Chef Automate to an existing project, such as one on GitHub or Atlassian Bitbucket. In this tutorial, you get starter code from GitHub but host your project in Chef Automate's Git repository.

In this part, you create a project and watch the `awesome_customers_delivery` cookbook move through each stage of the Chef Automate pipeline. You perform these tasks:

1. [Create the project and the pipeline](#step1)
1. [Watch the Verify stage run](#step2)
1. [Take a closer look at your Chef Automate project](#step3)
1. [Configure the build cookbook to publish to Chef server](#step4)
1. [Submit the change](#step5)
1. [Approve the change](#step6)
1. [Deliver the change](#step7)
1. [Integrate the change to your local master branch](#step8)
1. Learn how to [delete your Chef Automate project](#deletingthechefautomateproject)



Recall that you can use Chef Automate to deploy almost any kind of software or infrastructure project and that a [build cookbook](https://docs.chef.io/delivery_build_cookbook.html) defines how changes are verified, built, and deployed.

[delivery-truck](https://github.com/chef-cookbooks/delivery-truck) is a build cookbook that's designed specifically for Chef cookbook projects. You'll see how the `delivery-truck` cookbook can perform many common tasks that are needed to deliver Chef cookbooks, including:

* Running common cookbook test suites like [ChefSpec](https://docs.chef.io/chefspec.html), [Foodcritic](https://docs.chef.io/foodcritic.html), and [RuboCop](https://docs.chef.io/rubocop.html).
* Publishing your cookbook to Chef server, Chef Supermarket, GitHub, Atlassian Bitbucket, or another Git server.
* Triggering `chef-client` to run on nodes that use your cookbook.

[START_BOX]

## 1. Create the project and the pipeline

There are a few ways to [create a Chef Automate project](https://docs.chef.io/delivery_pipeline.html). Here, you use the `delivery init` command. This command:

* creates a project in Chef Automate, which includes a new Git repository that's hosted on the Chef Automate server.
* creates a default pipeline whose target branch is `master`.
* initializes the `master` branch in Chef Automate's Git repo from the existing `master` branch that you just cloned (`delivery init` detects whether there is an existing Git repository).
* creates a branch named `add-delivery-config`, which is based off of `master`.
* creates the <% fp '.delivery' %> directory and adds to it a build cookbook and a configuration file.
* submits the change for review.

First, move to the <% fp 'awesome_customers_delivery' %> directory.

```ps
# C:\Users\Administrator
$ cd C:\Users\Administrator\cookbooks\awesome_customers_delivery
```

Next, run `delivery init` from your local repository directory. When prompted, enter the password that's associated with your Chef Automate account.

If you're prompted to choose the default web browser, choose Google Chrome.

```ps

The `delivery` command uses your password to generate an API token that's used to make authorized requests to your Chef Automate server. The `delivery` command writes this API token to <% fp 'C:\Users\Administrator\.delivery\api-tokens' %>.

A browser window appears and the first stage of the pipeline, Verify, begins running its phases.

[COMMENT] The bottom of this page explains how to [delete your project](#deletingthechefautomateproject) if you need to start over or want to do the tutorial a second time.

## 2. Watch the Verify stage run

When you run `delivery init`, two things happen. The first stage of the pipeline, Verify, begins and the Chef Automate web interface appears. With it, you can trace the progress of the cookbook as it moves through each stage and its associated phases.

<img style="max-width:100%;" src="/assets/images/automate/wf-add-delivery-config-verify.png"/>

It's a good idea to watch each pipeline phase run at least once to gain a better understanding of what happens during the process.

As each of the unit, lint, and syntax phases moves to the <img style="box-shadow:none; margin:0; display:inline;" src="/assets/images/delivery/running_icon.png"/> state, click **+** to show the output log.

![](automate/wf-unit-open-log.png)

Every time a phase runs, the build node first runs the build cookbook's default recipe, <% fp 'default.rb' %>, as the `root` user to ensure that the build node has everything it needs to run. This step is important because you can have multiple build nodes &ndash; a build node that runs one phase will not necessarily have run any of the prior phases.

<img style="max-width:100%;" src="/assets/images/automate/wf-unit-output-log.png"/>

After the default recipe completes, the build node runs the recipe for the phase as the `dbuild` user.

![](delivery/syntax_output_log2.png)

Watch as each phase completes and enters the <img style="box-shadow:none; margin:0; display:inline;" src="/assets/images/delivery/passed_icon.png"/> state.

<img style="max-width:100%;" src="/assets/images/automate/wf-add-delivery-config-verify-passed.png"/>

Now that the Verify stage has completed, let's take a closer look at your project.

[END_BOX]

[START_BOX]

## 3. Take a closer look at your Chef Automate project

The `delivery init` command creates the <% fp '.delivery' %> directory at the root of your project. This directory contains two important pieces &ndash; a configuration file (<% fp 'config.json' %>) and the build cookbook (the <% fp 'build-cookbook' %> directory).

```ps

                            default.rb
```

Your build cookbook consists of recipes. Each recipe corresponds to a phase, such as lint or syntax. Any time that a phase runs, no matter in which stage, it uses the same recipe. For example, the recipe for the lint phase runs in the Verify and Build stages. You can use conditional logic to customize how the recipe behaves for a given stage.

<img src="/assets/images/delivery/delivery_full_workflow.svg" style="width: 100%; box-shadow: none;" />

Each phase runs on a build node. If you have multiple build nodes, phases can run in parallel, for example, unit and syntax. The automated installation process for this tutorial creates two build nodes.

The build node that's running Verify, for example, merges your changes into `master` on a temporary copy of the main repository and runs the tests against `master`.

How you define each phase depends on your project and its requirements. For example, if your project is a web application that contains JavaScript, you might run JSLint as part of the lint phase. Alternatively, if you don't currently run lint tests on your code, you can leave the phase empty or configure Chef Automate to skip it.

Our project is a Chef cookbook. Here's a brief summary of what each phase accomplishes.

* lint &ndash; run [Foodcritic](https://docs.chef.io/foodcritic.html) and [RuboCop](https://docs.chef.io/rubocop.html).
* syntax &ndash; run [knife cookbook test](https://docs.chef.io/knife_cookbook.html#test).
* unit &ndash; run [ChefSpec](https://docs.chef.io/chefspec.html).
* publish &ndash; upload `awesome_customers_delivery` and the cookbooks it depends on to the Chef server.
* deploy &ndash; use push jobs to run `chef-client` on the node that runs the web application.
* smoke &ndash; verify that the web server is at least minimally functional.

For this project, no specific action is required for the security, quality, provision, and functional phases.

[SKILL] [Learn more about Foodcritic, RuboCop, and other Chef testing tools](/skills/get-started-with-testing/).

To help implement these steps, we use the `delivery-truck` cookbook. This cookbook performs tasks that are typical for a cookbook project. For example, its unit recipe runs ChefSpec and its lint recipe runs Foodcritic and RuboCop. The `delivery-truck` cookbook is already included for you as a dependency of your build cookbook.

Here's how `delivery-truck` is referenced in your build cookbook's metadata file.

```ruby-Win32
# C:\Users\Administrator\cookbooks\awesome_customers_delivery\.delivery\build-cookbook\metadata.rb
name 'build-cookbook'
maintainer 'The Authors'
maintainer_email 'you@example.com'
license 'all_rights'
version '0.1.0'

depends 'delivery-truck'
```

Each of your build cookbook's 11 recipes includes the implementation provided by `delivery-truck`. Here's an example for the `lint` recipe.

```ruby-Win32
# C:\Users\Administrator\cookbooks\awesome_customers_delivery\.delivery\build-cookbook\recipes\lint.rb
#
# Cookbook Name:: build-cookbook
# Recipe:: lint
#
# Copyright (c) 2016 The Authors, All Rights Reserved.
include_recipe 'delivery-truck::lint'
```

Here's how [delivery-truck implements the lint phase](https://github.com/chef-cookbooks/delivery-truck/blob/master/recipes/lint.rb).

```ruby-Win32
# lint.rb
changed_cookbooks.each do |cookbook|
  # Run Foodcritic against any cookbooks that were modified.
  execute "lint_foodcritic_#{cookbook.name}" do
    command "foodcritic -f correctness #{foodcritic_tags} #{foodcritic_excludes} #{cookbook.path}"
  end

  # Run Rubocop against any cookbooks that were modified.
  execute "lint_rubocop_#{cookbook.name}" do
    command "rubocop #{cookbook.path}"
    environment(
      # workaround for https://github.com/bbatsov/rubocop/issues/2407
      'USER' => (ENV['USER'] || 'dbuild')
    )
    only_if { File.exist?(File.join(cookbook.path, '.rubocop.yml')) }
  end
end
```

You can modify a recipe in your build cookbook to fit your requirements. For example, you might add additional code or remove the `include_recipe` line entirely to specify your own implementation.

<% accordion('when-to-use-delivery-truck', 'When should you use the delivery-truck cookbook?') do %>

<% markdown do %>

For this project, the `delivery init` command detects the `awesome_customer_delivery` cookbook and automatically includes `delivery-truck` for you. This makes your build cookbook what's called a _wrapper cookbook_.

You'll likely want to use `delivery-truck` in a cookbook project because `delivery-truck` handles many common tasks for you. Because your build cookbook wraps `delivery-truck`, you can extend or replace the `delivery-truck` cookbook's behavior in your build cookbook.

If your project doesn't include a Chef cookbook, `delivery init` creates an empty build cookbook, meaning it won't generate a wrapper around `delivery-truck`.

Is there a common application type or pattern you'd like to see, similar to `delivery-truck`? [Start the discussion](https://discourse.chef.io/c/delivery) on Discourse.

A manual step is required to move to the Build stage. This is where your team decides whether the code can be merged into the `master` branch or more work is needed.

We're not quite ready yet to to merge the change to `master`. First, we need to configure the build cookbook to publish the `awesome_customers_delivery` cookbook to the Chef server.

[END_BOX]

[START_BOX]

## 4. Configure the build cookbook to publish to Chef server

In this step, you configure your build cookbook to publish the `awesome_customers_delivery` cookbook to the Chef server during the publish phase. Then you commit that change to the `add-delivery-config` branch and submit the change for review.

Recall that the `delivery init` command creates a file named <% fp '.delivery\config.json' %> in your project directory. This configuration file controls the behavior of your build cookbook. Here's what the file looks like.

```ruby-Win32
# C:\Users\Administrator\cookbooks\awesome_customers_delivery\.delivery\config.json
{
  "version": "2",
  "build_cookbook": {
    "name": "build-cookbook",
    "path": ".delivery/build-cookbook"
  },
  "skip_phases": [],
  "build_nodes": {},
  "dependencies": []
}
```

These configuration settings become node attributes on your build nodes. You can also use this file to [control how delivery-truck behaves](https://github.com/chef-cookbooks/delivery-truck#customizing-behavior-using-deliveryconfigjson).

To specify that the cookbook should be published to Chef server, modify your copy of <% fp '.delivery\config.json' %> like this.

```ruby-Win32
# C:\Users\Administrator\cookbooks\awesome_customers_delivery\.delivery\config.json
{
  "version": "2",
  "build_cookbook": {
    "name": "build-cookbook",
    "path": ".delivery/build-cookbook"
  },
  "skip_phases": [],
  "build_nodes": {},
  "dependencies": [],
  "delivery-truck": {
    "publish": {
      "chef_server": true
    }
  }
}
```

Run `git status`. You'll see that `add-delivery-config` is the current branch and that <% fp '.delivery\config.json' %> is not yet staged for commit.

```ps
# C:\Users\Administrator\cookbooks\awesome_customers_delivery
$ git status
On branch add-delivery-config
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)

        modified:   .delivery/config.json

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
```

Now run `git add` to stage <% fp '.delivery\config.json' %> for commit.

```ps
# C:\Users\Administrator\cookbooks\awesome_customers_delivery
$ git add .\.delivery\config.json
warning: LF will be replaced by CRLF in .delivery/config.json.
The file will have its original line endings in your working directory.
```

Now run `git commit` to commit the change.

```ps
# C:\Users\Administrator\cookbooks\awesome_customers_delivery
$ git commit -m "Publish to Chef server"
[add-delivery-config warning: LF will be replaced by CRLF in .delivery/config.json.
The file will have its original line endings in your working directory.

The file will have its original line endings in your working directory.
 1 file changed, 9 insertions(+), 4 deletions(-)
```

[END_BOX]

[START_BOX]

## 5. Submit the change

Run `delivery review` to submit your change to the `add-delivery-config` branch for review as a new patchset.

```ps
# C:\Users\Administrator\cookbooks\awesome_customers_delivery
$ delivery review
Chef Delivery
Loading configuration from C:\Users\Administrator\awesome_customers_delivery
Review for change add-delivery-config targeted for pipeline master
Created new patchset

901-84a3-4e01-acc7-fb9a549eeaac
```

[COMMENT] If you use GitHub, you know that pull requests let you tell others about your changes. The [delivery review](https://docs.chef.io/ctl_delivery.html#delivery-review) command is similar. It allows others to review your changes. Once approved, Chef Automate merges your changes into `master` and continues through the rest of the pipeline.

A browser window opens to show the pipeline in Chef Automate. The Verify stage is automatically triggered and runs the unit, lint and syntax phases.

[END_BOX]

[START_BOX]

## 6. Approve the change

The next step is to approve the change. This is a manual step, where people on your team have a chance to review the code and promote it to the Build stage.

Let's review and approve the changes. In practice, others on your team would assist with the review.

From the **Review** tab, click on a few files to see how they changed. Here's an example for the change you made to <% fp '.delivery\config.json' %>

![](automate/wf-review-config.png)

The files are new, so each change appears as an add <img style="box-shadow:none; margin:0; display:inline;" src="/assets/images/delivery/review_add_icon.png"/> operation. For an existing file that's been modified <img style="box-shadow:none; margin:0; display:inline;" src="/assets/images/delivery/review_modify_icon.png"/>, you would see the diff between the current version and the proposed change.

Scroll down to the bottom of Patchset 2 and enter a comment.

![](automate/wf-review-add-comment.png)

Click the **Add Comment** button.

Scroll back to the top of the patchset and click **Approve**.

![](automate/wf-review-approve.png)

Then click **Confirm**.

![](automate/wf-review-approve-modal.png)

The **Approve** action merges the `add-delivery-config` branch into the `master` branch and deletes the `add-delivery-config` branch from the server.

[COMMENT] You need to first wait for the unit, lint, and syntax phases to complete before you can approve a patchset. This ensures that all tests pass before the change is merged into the target branch.

<% accordion('approve-code-changes', 'When is the right time to approve changes?') do %>

<% markdown do %>

In this tutorial, you approve and deliver your own changes. In practice, you'll need to decide with your organization the criteria for approving and shipping changes.

Even though just one person presses the **Approve** button, multiple people may be involved in the review process. At Chef, we follow the "four eyes" rule, where a total of four eyes is required to approve a code change.

After two people approve a code change in the **Review** tab and there are no unresolved issues, the change can be approved and move to the next pipeline stage. Some code reviews involve multiple iterations and approaches, others are as simple as this:

![](/assets/images/delivery/four-eyes-rule.png)

<% end %>

<% end %>

[END_BOX]

[START_BOX]

## 7. Deliver the change

After you approve the change, it moves to the Build stage.

<img src="/assets/images/delivery/delivery_full_workflow_build.svg" style="width: 100%; box-shadow: none;" />

The unit, lint, and syntax phases run again on the build node. Rerunning the tests ensures that they continue to pass after the change is merged to `master`.

The Build stage also runs the security and quality phases. These recipes do not have any logic, so nothing happens. Then the publish phase runs. This phase creates an artifact (in our case, a cookbook) that is a release candidate. Recall that you configured `delivery-truck` to publish the `awesome_customers_delivery` cookbook to Chef server. `delivery-truck` runs the `knife cookbook upload` command to do that ([source code](https://github.com/chef-cookbooks/delivery-truck/blob/master/recipes/publish.rb)).

<img src="/assets/images/automate/wf-build-stage-running.png" style="width: 100%; box-shadow: none;" />

Trace the Build stage through each of its phases. After the Build stage completes, the process moves to the Acceptance stage.

<img src="/assets/images/delivery/delivery_full_workflow_acceptance.svg" style="width: 100%; box-shadow: none;" />

Beginning with the Acceptance stage, the pipeline switches from analyzing the project's source code to verifying the artifacts produced in the Build stage. The goal of the Acceptance stage is for the team to make a decision about whether the change should go all the way out to production or not.

The Acceptance stage runs the provision, deploy, smoke, and functional phases.

The provision phase is where you can bring up infrastructure to run your artifact. The automated Chef Automate installation provides an Ubuntu server to run the cookbook during the Acceptance stage. This server is already bootstrapped to the Chef server, so no specific action is required.

The deploy phase deploys the artifact created in the Build stage. The `delivery-truck` cookbook submits a push job that runs `chef-client` to deploy the `awesome_customers_delivery` cookbook to the infrastructure that's associated with the Acceptance stage.

<% accordion('deployment-process', 'Learn more about the deployment process') do %>

<%= partial 'deployment-process' %>

<% end %>

<br>

The smoke and functional recipes do not have any logic, so nothing happens. You'll implement the smoke phase later in this tutorial.

After the Acceptance stage completes, navigate to [http://acceptance.chordata.biz](http://acceptance.chordata.biz). You'll see the Customers web application:

<img style="max-width:100%;" src="/assets/images/automate/acceptance-customers-verify.png"/>

You haven't yet made changes to the `awesome_customers_delivery` cookbook, so the Customers web application will look the same as it did when you ran `chef-client` manually in the previous tutorial.

After confirming that the web application comes up as expected, navigate back to the Chef Automate web interface and press the **Deliver** button. Pressing the **Deliver** button is a confirmation that the artifact can be released. The artifact will move through the next three pipeline stages automatically.

![](automate/wf-delivery-init-deliver.png)

Press the **Confirm** button from the dialog that appears.

![](automate/wf-delivery-init-confirm-delivery.png)

You'll see the process move through the Union, Rehearsal, and Delivered stages.

<img src="/assets/images/delivery/delivery_full_workflow_shared.svg" style="width: 100%; box-shadow: none;" />

The automation you ran to install Chef Automate provides infrastructure for the Acceptance, Union, Rehearsal, and Delivered stages. We recommend you watch as these stages run. Then come back to take a closer look at the role of each stage.

As the Union, Rehearsal, and Delivered stages finish, you can verify the Customers web application comes up in a browser. Here's an example for Union:

<img style="max-width:100%;" src="/assets/images/automate/union-customers-verify.png"/>

<hr />

The Union, Rehearsal, and Delivered stages form a shared pipeline, where all the projects that make up the entire system come together. All three stages have the same phases.

The Union stage is where you test for interactions between interdependent projects to see if your change has any impact.

If all phases of Union succeed, then the Rehearsal stage is triggered. Rehearsal increases confidence in the artifacts and the deployment by repeating the process that occurred in Union in a different environment.

If a failure occurs in Union, Rehearsal serves a different purpose. When you submit a new change and it fixes the break in Union, you know that a sequence of two changes, one that breaks the system, and one that comes after and fixes it, results in a healthy system. You do not yet know what happens when you apply the cumulative change to an environment that never saw the failure. The Rehearsal stage provides that environment.

Delivered is the final stage of the pipeline. What "delivered" means for your system is up to you. It could mean deploying the change so that it is live and receiving production traffic, or it might mean publishing a set of artifacts so they are accessible to your customers.

When all stages have finished, you'll see this.

<img src="/assets/images/automate/wf-delivery-init-delivered.png" style="width: 100%; box-shadow: none;" />

Congratulations! You now have a functioning Chef Automate pipeline.

<% accordion('stages-environments', 'Stages versus environments') do %>

<% markdown do %>

In this tutorial, we use the terms _stages_ and _environments_ quite frequently. For example, there's the Acceptance stage and there's the Acceptance environment. Both are related, but it's important to distinguish between the two.

In this example, the Acceptance _stage_ refers to the pipeline stage and its four phases &ndash; provision, deploy, smoke, and functional. The Acceptance _environment_ refers to the infrastructure environment that's associated with the Acceptance stage. In this tutorial, the Acceptance environment is an Ubuntu 14.04 server that applies the `awesome_customers_delivery` cookbook to configure the Customers web application. The Acceptance stage deploys the Customers web application by triggering `chef-client` to run on the Ubuntu server.

You can set up a distinct runtime environment for each of the Acceptance, Union, Rehearsal, and Delivered stages of the pipeline. It's also possible to allow multiple stages to share the same environment. Although in this tutorial your Chef Automate project is a Chef cookbook, a project can be an application or  some other artifact that doesn't involve Chef. Your infrastructure environments would be whatever you require for the artifact to run.

## 8. Integrate the change to your local master branch

When you clicked **Approve** during the Verify stage, Chef Automate merged the `add-delivery-config` branch into `master` on Chef Automate's Git server. Now you need to pull Chef Automate's updated `master` into your local `master` branch.

First, switch to the `master` branch.

```ps
# C:\Users\Administrator\cookbooks\awesome_customers_delivery
$ git checkout master
Switched to branch 'master'
Your branch is up-to-date with 'delivery/master'.
```

Now pull the latest from Chef Automate to your local repo.

```ps
# C:\Users\Administrator\cookbooks\awesome_customers_delivery

[COMMENT] If you get the error "error: cannot stat '.delivery': Permission denied", restart Atom and run `git pull --prune` a second time.

The [--prune](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-prune) option removes references to any remote-tracking branches that no longer exist on the remote server. `delivery/_for/master/add-delivery-config` is an intermediate branch that Chef Automate creates as part of the integration process.

## Deleting the Chef Automate project

If you ever need to start over, or you complete the tutorial and want to delete this project, you'll need to log in to the Chef Automate server (for example, over SSH) and run the `delivery-ctl delete-project` command.

The Windows workstation [provides a hosts file and SSH config](/automate/install/managing-your-aws-instances#connectingtoyourawsinstancesfromthewindowsworkstation) to make it easy to access each system over SSH.

Here's how to connect to the Chef Automate server over SSH.

```ps
$ ssh delivery.chordata.biz
```

The `delivery-ctl delete-project` command takes your enterprise, organization, and project names as arguments, like this.

```bash
$ sudo delivery-ctl delete-project ENTERPRISE ORGANIZATION PROJECT
```

Here's how to delete the `awesome_customers_delivery` project in the tutorial environment from your SSH session:

```bash
$ sudo delivery-ctl delete-project mammalia diprotodontia awesome_customers_delivery
Successfully deleted project: 'mammalia/diprotodontia/awesome_customers_delivery'
```
