To know the latest version of any cookbook on Chef Supermarket, browse to its page and view the latest version from the version selection box. For [haproxy](https://supermarket.chef.io/cookbooks/haproxy), it's:

![haproxy cookbook version](misc/supermarket_haproxy_version.png)

Or, get the info from the `knife supermarket` command, like this.

```bash
# ~/learn-chef
$ knife supermarket show haproxy | grep latest_version
latest_version:     https://supermarket.chef.io/api/v1/cookbooks/haproxy/versions/1.6.7
```
