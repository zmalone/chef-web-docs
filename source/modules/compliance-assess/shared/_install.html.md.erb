The Chef compliance scanner runs on Red Hat Enterprise Linux, CentOS, and Ubuntu. You can install the Chef compliance scanner on your own hardware, a cloud instance, or a virtual machine.

[COMMENT] Alternatively, you can bring up the Chef compliance scanner [through the AWS Marketplace](https://docs.chef.io/aws_marketplace.html#chef-compliance-ami). The AWS Marketplace setup comes preconfigured with the necessary system requirements and network settings. After installing from the AWS Marketplace, you can move to [step 3](#step3).

[START_BOX]

## 1. Install the Chef compliance scanner

[COMMENT] We use `sudo` to highlight where root access is required. You can omit `sudo` from the commands if you're running as the root user.

Follow these steps to run the Chef compliance scanner on your own hardware or virtual machine:

1. [Choose your platform](https://docs.chef.io/install_compliance.html#platforms) and bring up a system to run the Chef compliance scanner.
1. Log in to your server directly, typically over SSH. Then, [review the prerequisites](https://docs.chef.io/install_compliance.html#prerequisites) to ensure your system is ready.

    The Chef compliance scanner requires a resolvable hostname. If you're running the Chef compliance scanner on a virtual machine or other system that's not registered with a name server, choose a hostname such as `chef-compliance.test`.

    If you're running the Chef compliance scanner on Red Hat Enterprise Linux or CentOS, these commands will perform the prerequisite tasks on most configurations. Replace <% ph 'HOSTNAME' %> and <% ph 'IP_ADDRESS' %> with your values.

    ```bash
    $ sudo yum install -y ntp
    $ sudo chkconfig ntpd on
    $ ntpdate -s time.nist.gov
    $ sudo hostname HOSTNAME
    $ echo "IP_ADDRESS HOSTNAME" | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts
    ```

    Here are the corresponding commands for Ubuntu:

    ```bash
    $ sudo apt-get update
    $ sudo apt-get install -y curl ntp
    $ sudo service ntp start
    $ ntpdate -s time.nist.gov
    $ sudo hostname HOSTNAME
    $ echo "IP_ADDRESS HOSTNAME" | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts
    ```

    Here's a complete example that sets up a CentOS virtual machine to run the Chef compliance scanner.

    ```bash
    $ sudo yum install ntp
    $ sudo chkconfig ntpd on
    $ ntpdate -s time.nist.gov
    $ sudo hostname chef-compliance.test
    $ echo "192.168.145.140 chef-compliance.test" | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts
    ```

    If you're running the Chef compliance scanner on a virtual machine or other system that's not registered with a name server, add a corresponding entry to your local <% fp '/etc/hosts' %> file to enable access to the Chef compliance scanner from your workstation. For example:

    ```ruby
    # /etc/hosts
    ##
    # Host Database
    ##
    127.0.0.1	    localhost
    ::1             localhost
    fe80::1%lo0	    localhost

    192.168.145.140 chef-compliance.test
    ```

1. From your server, run this command to install the Chef compliance scanner.

    ```bash
    $ curl -L https://omnitruck.chef.io/install.sh | sudo bash -s -- -P compliance
    ```

    Alternatively, you can [download and install the package manually](https://downloads.chef.io/compliance/).

1. Run these commands to ensure the services are configured and ready to accept connections.

    ```bash
    $ sudo chef-compliance-ctl reconfigure --accept-license
    $ sudo chef-compliance-ctl restart
    ```

    The `--accept-license` flag is required to accept the [Chef Master License and Services Agreement](https://docs.chef.io/chef_license.html#chef-mlsa) (Chef MLSA).

## 2. Perform the initial setup

> In this part, you access the the Chef compliance scanner web interface remotely from a web browser.

Log in to the the Chef compliance scanner web interface and perform the initial setup.

From your computer, open a web browser and navigate to your server's setup page. The URL comes in this form:

**https://<% ph 'fqdn' %>/#/setup**

The Chef compliance scanner comes with a self-signed certificate and you'll probably see a warning about it. For the purposes of the tutorial, it's safe to accept the certificate. In a production environment, you can [configure an SSL certificate](https://docs.chef.io/install_compliance.html#configure-ssl) that's rooted by a trusted certificate authority (CA).

Next, click the **Setup Chef Compliance** button.

![](compliance/setup_button.png)

Review the **Online Master License and Services Agreement** and then click **Accept**.

![](compliance/accept_license_button.png)

Next, fill in the details for the administrator account and click **Next**. Save your username and password somewhere safe.

![](compliance/create_admin_account.png)

On the **Review** page, verify your account details and then click **Configure**.

![](compliance/configure_button.png)

After the process completes, click the **Dashboard** button. Then, enter your administrator account details and click **Sign in**.

## 3. Review the dashboard

The dashboard appears when you sign in. This is where you manage nodes, initiate scans, and review reports.

![](compliance/dashboard.png)

Click through each of the menu options to get a sense of what you can do. Here's a brief description of each option.

* **Dashboard** &mdash; where you manage the nodes that you scan for compliance.
* **Reports** &mdash; where you review the results of your compliance scans.
* **Jobs** &mdash; displays the status of scheduled scans.
* **Compliance** &mdash; displays the available [compliance profiles](https://docs.chef.io/compliance.html#compliance-profiles). The Chef compliance scanner comes with a set of preconfigured profiles. You can also add your own.
* **Settings** &mdash; where you manage the private keys that allow the Chef compliance scanner to connect to your nodes. Although key-based authentication can provide better security, you can also configure the Chef compliance scanner to connect to your servers using passwords.

You can view which users are logged in or log out of your session from the menu located at the upper-right corner.

You can also manage organizations and users from the menu located at the bottom-left corner.

Next, you'll prepare a node to scan.
