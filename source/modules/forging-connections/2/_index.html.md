## Strong connections make better products

Aside from making your company a better place to work, there is another very practical reason to broaden your network. Someday you're going to have a big idea that you know will really move the needle on your business.

To make that idea happen, you're going to need feedback and consensus from people who work in many different areas of your company. All the bonds you've formed company wide will come into play.

As you circulate your plan it transmutes and becomes not just your plan but the sales team's plan, and the business development teams plan and the operation team's plan. Everyone has a sense of ownership and is invested in seeing the plan succeed.

It's possible to see a plan fail because your bonds are not inclusive enough. Build consensus for projects by prioritizing the people in your company.
