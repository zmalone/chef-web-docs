<%= partial '../../shared/get-set-up/intro' %>

In this part, you'll bring up an Ubuntu 14.04 instance on [Google Compute Engine](https://cloud.google.com/compute/).

You'll also learn how to [clean up](#cleaningup) your virtual machine when you're done with this module.

<% accordion('test-configuration', 'Test configuration', true) do %>

<% markdown do %>

The output you see might differ depending on the specific machine image that you choose. The version of the Chef Development Kit that you use can also affect the output that you see. We recommend that you install the components as directed in this module, using the specific versions that have been tested.

For technical support with Google Cloud Platform, [visit the support page](https://cloud.google.com/support/). We're also happy to help as best we can.

[START_BOX]

## 1. Access your Google Cloud Platform account

Log in to your Google Cloud Platform account. If you don't have an account, Google is offering a [60-day free trial](https://cloud.google.com/compute/) for up to $300 (USD) of usage.

If you are unable to use Google Cloud Platform, you can [try a different option](/modules/learn-the-basics/ubuntu/) for this module.

[END_BOX]

[START_BOX]

## 2. Launch an Ubuntu 14.04 instance

Next, bring up an Ubuntu instance on Compute Engine.

If you're new to Google Cloud Platform, Google's [Quickstart Using a Linux VM](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/quickstart-linux) tutorial walks you through the creation of your first Linux virtual machine.

[COMMENT] This module refers to the Google Cloud Platform Console documentation to help you manage your virtual machine. Google also provides a [command-line interface](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/gcloud-compute/) (CLI).

When you're ready to continue with this module, bring up a standard **Ubuntu 14.04 LTS** system.

When you choose the machine type, select **micro**, **small**, or **1 vCPU**. **micro** instances cost less, but **small** or **1 vCPU** will give you better performance.

When you choose the firewall settings, select **Allow HTTP traffic** and **Allow HTTPS traffic**. This ensures your system is connectable on ports 22 (SSH), 80 (HTTP), and 443 (HTTPS).

[COMMENT] Technically, port 443 is not required for this module. But setting up that port now prepares you for the next module, where you'll configure your server to be managed remotely.

## 3. If you're running Windows &ndash; verify your SSH client

In this module, you'll connect to your Linux instance over SSH. To do so, you'll need an SSH client. macOS and most Linux distributions come with an SSH client. On Windows, you need to install one.

The easiest way to set up an SSH client is to install the Chef Development Kit (Chef DK) on your workstation. Chef DK version 0.15 and later comes with [Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win), which includes an SSH client.

Installing the Chef DK now also prepares you for the next module, where you'll use Chef to manage a server remotely from your workstation.

There are two ways to install the Chef DK on Windows.

1. [Download and run the installer](https://downloads.chef.io/chef-dk/) from the Chef downloads page.
2. Run the installer from PowerShell.

<% command_snippet(path: 'learn-the-basics/ubuntu/virtualbox/set-up-a-machine-to-manage/install-the-chef-dk/install-chefdk', workstation: 'windows') %>

After you install the Chef DK, verify that Git and an SSH client are set up properly.

First, open the **Chef Development Kit** shortcut from the desktop or **Start** menu. Open the shortcut as **Adminstrator**.

![](misc/chefdk-desktop-shortcut-windows.png)

Next, run these commands.

<% command_snippet(path: 'learn-the-basics/ubuntu/virtualbox/set-up-a-machine-to-manage/verify-your-ssh-client/git--version', workstation: 'windows') %>

<% command_snippet(path: 'learn-the-basics/ubuntu/virtualbox/set-up-a-machine-to-manage/verify-your-ssh-client/ssh-no-args', workstation: 'windows', features: [:stdin, :stderr]) %>

Keep your **Chef Development Kit** window open for the next part.

## 4. Connect to your Ubuntu instance

Next, connect to your instance.

The Google documention shows a [few ways to connect](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/connecting-to-instance), including [connecting from your browser](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/connecting-to-instance#sshinbrowser).

Here's an example of how to connect over SSH from the command line using key-based authentication. (Replace <% fp '~/.ssh/id_rsa' %> with the path to your private key file, <% ph 'chef' %> with your username, and <% ph '104.196.49.219' %> with your IP address.)

```bash
$ ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa chef@104.196.49.219
The authenticity of host '52.87.191.240 (52.87.191.240)' can't be established.
RSA key fingerprint is SHA256:YiT1n9QZ64GnXcCeRpYMOLxpJZ9IjCft1Fpf5tvAFuQ.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)? yes
Warning: Permanently added '52.87.191.240' (RSA) to the list of known hosts.

## 5. Install the Chef DK on your Ubuntu instance

Remember, for learning purposes, you'll start by managing a server directly. To do that, you'll install the Chef DK on your virtual machine. The Chef DK provides tools that enable you to manage your servers remotely from your workstation. But it also provides tools that allow you to configure a machine directly.

From your SSH connection, first update the `apt` cache and then install `curl`.

```bash
# ~
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get -y install curl
```

Next, run this to install the Chef DK.

<% command_snippet(path: 'learn-the-basics/ubuntu/gcp/set-up-your-own-server/install-the-chef-dk/install-chefdk', workstation: 'ubuntu', features: [:stdin, :stderr, :stdout]) %>

The `-c` and `-v` arguments specify the Chef DK version this module was last tested with.

[END_BOX]

[START_BOX]

## 6. Prepare a text editor on your Ubuntu instance

Because Chef uses code to express infrastructure policy, it's important that you use a text editor that provides features such as syntax highlighting and line numbering.

From your SSH connection, install a text editor now. Because you're accessing your server from an SSH connection, choose a command-line text editor such as `emacs`, `nano`, or `vim`.

If you're new to using command-line text editors on Ubuntu, here are some resources to help get you started.

<% accordion('emacs-gs', 'Emacs') do %>

<%= partial 'layouts/partials/emacs_gs_deb' %>

<% end %>

<% accordion('nano-gs', 'Nano') do %>

<%= partial 'layouts/partials/nano_gs_deb' %>

<% end %>

<% accordion('vim-gs', 'Vim') do %>

<%= partial 'layouts/partials/vim_gs_deb' %>

<% end %>

[START_BOX]

## Cleaning up

After you complete this module, be sure to [destroy your virtual machine](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/stopping-or-deleting-an-instance#"delete_an_instance).

Or, you can leave your server running if you want to use it to complete the next module. You can temporarily [stop and later resume](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/stopping-or-deleting-an-instance#stop_an_instance) your instance to reduce cost.
