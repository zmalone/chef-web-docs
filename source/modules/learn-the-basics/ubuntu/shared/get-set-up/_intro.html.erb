The normal Chef workflow involves managing servers remotely from your workstation. But in this tutorial, you'll log in to a server and manage it directly to get a feel for how Chef works.

<% accordion('chef-workflow', 'Learn more about the Chef workflow') do %>

<% markdown do %>
<%= partial 'layouts/partials/chef_workflow', :locals => { server_name: "Ubuntu" } %>
<% end %>

<% end %>
