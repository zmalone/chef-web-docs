In this part, you'll bring up a Windows Server 2012 R2 instance on [Google Compute Engine](https://cloud.google.com/compute/).

You'll also learn how to [clean up](#cleaningup) your virtual machine when you're done with this tutorial.

The sample output you see might differ depending on the machine image that you choose. The version of the Chef Development Kit that you use can also affect the output that you see. We recommend that you install the components as directed in the tutorial, using the specific versions that have been tested.

For technical support with Google Cloud Platform, [visit the support page](https://cloud.google.com/support/). We're also happy to help as best we can.

[START_BOX]

## 1. Access your Google Cloud Platform account

Log in to your Google Cloud Platform account. If you don't have an account, Google is offering a [60-day free trial](https://cloud.google.com/compute/) for up to $300 (USD) of usage.

If you are unable to use Google Cloud Platform, you can [try a different option](/tutorials/learn-the-basics/windows/) for this tutorial.

[START_BOX]

## 2. Launch a Windows Server 2012 R2 instance

Next, bring up a Windows Server instance on Compute Engine.

If you're new to Google Cloud Platform, Google's [Quickstart Using a Windows VM](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/quickstart-windows) tutorial walks you through the creation of your first Windows Server virtual machine.

[COMMENT] This tutorial refers to the Google Cloud Platform Console documentation to help you manage your virtual machine. Google also provides a [command-line interface](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/gcloud-compute/) (CLI).

When you choose the machine type, **1 vCPU** or **2 vCPU**. **2 vCPU** comes with more memory and will give you better performance.

When you choose the firewall settings, select **Allow HTTP traffic** and **Allow HTTPS traffic**. This ensures your system is connectable on ports 22 (SSH), 80 (HTTP), and 443 (HTTPS).

[COMMENT] Technically, port 443 is not required for this tutorial. But setting up that port now prepares you for the next tutorial, where you'll configure your server to be managed remotely.

## 3. Connect to your Windows Server instance

Next, connect to your instance over Remote Desktop. The Google documentation [explains how](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/windows/connecting-to-windows-instance).

[END_BOX]

[START_BOX]

## 4. Install the Chef DK on your Windows Server instance

Remember, for learning purposes, you'll start by managing a server directly. To do that, you'll install the Chef DK on your virtual machine. The Chef DK provides tools that enable you to manage your servers remotely from your workstation. But it also provides tools that allow you to configure a machine directly.

From your SSH connection, run this from the command line to install the Chef DK.

<% command_snippet(path: 'learn-the-basics/windows/gcp/set-up-your-own-server/install-the-chef-dk/install-chefdk', workstation: 'windows', features: [:stdin, :stdout]) %>

The `-channel` and `-version` arguments specify the Chef DK version this tutorial was last tested with.

[END_BOX]

[START_BOX]

## 5. Prepare a text editor on your Windows Server instance

Because Chef uses code to express infrastructure policy, it's important that you use a text editor that provides features such as syntax highlighting and line numbering.

From your Remote Desktop connection, install a text editor now.

If you don't have a preferred text editor, here are some that are popular among Chef users:

* [Atom](http://atom.io)
* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com)
* [Sublime Text 2](http://www.sublimetext.com)

## Cleaning up

After you complete the tutorial, be sure to [destroy your virtual machine](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/stopping-or-deleting-an-instance#"delete_an_instance).

Or, you can leave your server running if you want to use it to complete the next tutorial. You can temporarily [stop and later resume](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/stopping-or-deleting-an-instance#stop_an_instance) your instance to reduce cost.

Now that you have your virtual machine with the Chef DK and a text editor set up, let's use Chef to configure a file, a kind of _resource_, on it.
