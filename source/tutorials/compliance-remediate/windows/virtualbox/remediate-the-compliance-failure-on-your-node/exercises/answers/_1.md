Local development gives you a safe environment to experiment and try new things. By starting with local development with Test Kitchen, you can verify configuration changes on temporary test instances before you apply the updated configuration to your production servers.

Achieving the desired configuration is often an iterative process. As an example, recall that the password complexity rule checks the result of the `ufw status` command.

Your first attempt at a solution might simply enable UFW, like this.

```ruby
# ~/learn-chef/cookbooks/ufw/recipes/default.rb
execute 'Enable UFW' do
  command 'ufw enable'
  not_if 'ufw status | grep "^Status:\sactive"'
end
```

However, you would find that this configuration doesn't do what you expect. By default, the `ufw enable` command prompts you to confirm whether to enable UFW. Because you want an automated solution, you might revise the command to include the `--force` flag to suppress the prompt, like this.

```ruby
# ~/learn-chef/cookbooks/ufw/recipes/default.rb
execute 'Enable UFW' do
  command 'ufw --force enable'
  not_if 'ufw status | grep "^Status:\sactive"'
end
```

Although this configuration enables UFW, you would discover that it prevents all remote access to the system, including SSH access! That's because UFW's defaults are to deny all incoming connections. You likely would not want this to happen on a production system or any other long-running system in your network.

With Test Kitchen, if you place the system in an unrecoverable state, you simply run `kitchen destroy` to destroy your instance, fix your remediation code, and then run `kitchen converge` to apply it to a new instance.

Although a complete solution might involve setting up access to additional ports and restricting access to trusted IP addresses, this code achieves the desired state while allowing remote access to the system.

```ruby
# ~/learn-chef/cookbooks/ufw/recipes/default.rb
execute 'Enable SSH access' do
  command 'ufw allow ssh'
  not_if 'ufw status | grep "22\s*ALLOW\s*Anywhere"'
end

execute 'Enable UFW' do
  command 'ufw --force enable'
  not_if 'ufw status | grep "^Status:\sactive"'
end
```
