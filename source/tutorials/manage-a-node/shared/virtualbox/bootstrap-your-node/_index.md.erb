Recall that any computer that's managed by a Chef server is called a _node_, and that `chef-client` is the command that applies the policy defined by your cookbooks to a node. We call the process that installs `chef-client` on a node and the initial checkin to the Chef server _bootstrapping_ the node.

In this part you'll bootstrap your <%= os %> node and execute the `<%= cookbook %>` cookbook on it.

[START_BOX]

## 1. Get your node's connection details

[knife bootstrap](https://docs.chef.io/knife_bootstrap.html) is the command you use to bootstrap a node. As part of the `knife bootstrap` command, you specify arguments depending on how you would normally connect to your node over SSH. For example, you might connect to your system using key-based authentication or password authentication.

[The other versions of this tutorial](/tutorials/manage-a-node/rhel/) describe the bootstrap process more generally. But because your <%= os %> node is managed by Vagrant and VirtualBox, you can bootstrap it by providing its SSH [forwarded port](https://www.vagrantup.com/docs/networking/forwarded_ports.html).

From your <% fp '~/learn-chef/chef-server' %> directory, run the following `vagrant ssh-config` command to get connection details for your node.

<% command_snippet(page: current_page, path: "bootstrap-your-node/vagrant-ssh-config-node1-#{os.downcase}") %>

Note the values of `Port` and `IdentityFile`. You'll use them in the next step.

In this example, any network traffic that's sent to port 2200 on your workstation (**localhost** in the next step) will be forwarded to port 22 (the SSH port) on your virtual machine.

## 2. Run the bootstrap command

[WINDOWS] Remember, if your workstation is running Windows, we recommend that you <%= link_to 'open a Chef DK command prompt', current_page.first_page, anchor: 'step2' %> to ensure your PowerShell session is set up to work with Chef.

From your <% fp '~/learn-chef' %> directory, run the following command to bootstrap your node. Replace the values of `--ssh-port` and `--identity-file` with your values.

<% command_snippet(page: current_page, path: "bootstrap-your-node/bootstrap-node1-#{os.downcase}", features: [:stdin, :stderr, :stdout]) %>

In a more production-like environment, you would replace <% ph 'localhost' %> with your node's IP address or hostname and omit the `--ssh-port` argument.

[COMMENT] The optional `--node-name` argument uniquely identifies the node with the Chef server. Its value can be whatever you want. The server's FQDN is the default. Here we use `node1-<%= os.downcase %>`.

## 3. Confirm the result

Two things just happened.

First, your node was associated with your Chef server. To verify this, run the `knife node list` command.

<% command_snippet(page: current_page, path: "bootstrap-your-node/knife-node-list-node1-#{os.downcase}", features: [:stdin, :stdout]) %>

You can use the `knife node show` command to view data about your node.

<% command_snippet(page: current_page, path: "bootstrap-your-node/knife-node-show-node1-#{os.downcase}", features: [:stdin, :stdout]) %>

The second thing that happened was that your node did an initial checkin with the Chef server and ran the `<%= cookbook %>` cookbook. That's because you specifed `<%= cookbook %>` as the `--run-list` argument.

To verify the configuration, run the following `curl` command.

<% command_snippet(page: current_page, path: "bootstrap-your-node/curl-node1-#{os.downcase}-1", features: [:stdin, :stdout]) %>

[END_BOX]

<% next_page(current_page) do %>

The `knife bootstrap` command established an SSH connection to the node, installed `chef-client`, downloaded the `<%= cookbook %>` cookbook on the node, and ran it. In one command, Chef carried out most of the steps you previously performed manually.

Next let's modify your configuration by adding some info about your web server to your home page.
